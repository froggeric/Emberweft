# Changelog

All notable changes to Emberweft are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Emberweft is **source-available** (PolyForm Noncommercial). The CPU renderer is a
faithful Swift port of the flam3 algorithm; the final license (including any GPL
implications of porting flam3) is the owner's decision and under review.

## [M1] — CPU Reference Renderer + CLI

A correct, deterministic CPU fractal-flame renderer that parses `.flam3`, renders
a still PNG, and is validated against the dev-only `flam3` oracle — exposed
through an `emberweft render|validate|info` CLI. The CPU reference is the oracle
against which the M2 Metal renderer will be validated (Reference-then-Optimize).

### Faithful flam3 port
The CPU reference is a **faithful Swift port of flam3's algorithms** (not an
approximation), achieving near-byte-exact parity: **51–72 dB PSNR, SSIM ≈ 1.0**
on all 6 frozen golden genomes, against single-threaded strict-IEEE `flam3`.
Ported: affine convention (`tx=a·x+c·y+e`, `ty=b·x+d·y+f`), the full classic
variation set with flam3's `precalc_atan = atan2(x,y)`, the **ISAAC RNG** (byte-exact
vs flam3's `isaac.c`) with its exact chaos-game consumption order, and the complete
display pipeline (log-density k1/k2, Gaussian spatial filter, `calcAlpha`/`calcNewRGB`,
gamma/vibrancy/background). All renderer math is in `Double` to match flam3 precision.

### Added
- **FlameKit** — genome value model (`AffineTransform`, `Xform`, `Flame`, `Palette`,
  `Camera`, `Quality`); `.flam3` XML parser (both Apophysis `<color>` and flam3
  hex-block palettes) and canonical serializer with round-trip equality; temporal
  interpolation (log-space scale, endpoint-correct size/quality); the classic
  variation registry; deterministic **PCG32** and faithful **ISAAC** RNGs.
- **FlameReference** — single-threaded deterministic chaos-game engine → histogram →
  density-estimation filter → log-density/palette/gamma tone-mapping → RGBA8;
  `ReferenceRenderer.render(flame:params:)`; PNG I/O via ImageIO (sRGB, opaque).
- **`emberweft` CLI** — testable `EmberweftCLI` library + thin `EmberweftApp`
  executable; `render`/`validate`/`info`/`--version`, CPU backend, exit codes.
- **Golden oracle harness** — 6 frozen genomes; `Tools/regen_goldens.sh` invoking
  the dev-only `flam3` oracle with pinned `seed`/`isaac_seed`/`nthreads=1`
  (single-threaded, byte-reproducible); committed reference PNGs; PSNR/SSIM parity
  gate (`GoldenParityTests`) that passes without `flam3` installed in CI.
- **Tests** — 61 tests: unit (genome, RNG, variations, parser, serializer,
  interpolation), chaos-game (determinism, budget, finiteness, termination),
  tone-mapping/density, PNG round-trip + orientation, property tests, golden
  parity, CLI behavior, and a byte-stable CLI PNG snapshot.

### Fixed (parity oracle findings)
- **Affine convention** — was `x'=a·x+b·y+c`; correct is `tx=a·x+c·y+e`,
  `ty=b·x+d·y+f` (verified against `flam3` `parser.c`/`variations.c`).
- **Variation angle source** — flam3's basic variations use `precalc_atan = atan2(x,y)`,
  not `atan2(y,x)`.
- **Final-xform feedback** — the final xform must transform a separate binning
  point, not feed back into the chaos-game trajectory (`flam3.c:246-296`).
- **Golden harness `nthreads`** — goldens must render `nthreads=1`; flam3's default
  multi-threaded render is a non-reproducible, machine-dependent sample split that a
  single-threaded reference cannot match. (Root cause of the apparent "julia parity
  gap" — Emberweft was byte-correct throughout.)

### Notes
- `flam3` remains a **dev-only external oracle** — built from source outside the
  repo, invoked only by `Tools/regen_goldens.sh`; never linked, bundled, copied,
  or distributed. CI runs the parity gate against committed PNGs without `flam3`.
- Density estimation is the M1 approximation (frozen goldens set
  `estimator_radius="0"`, so it is not exercised by the parity gate); the true
  flam3 estimator is deferred until non-zero-radius goldens are added.
